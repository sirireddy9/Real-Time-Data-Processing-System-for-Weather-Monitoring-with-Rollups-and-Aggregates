# Real-Time-Data-Processing-System-for-Weather-Monitoring-with-Rollups-and-Aggregates
This project is a real-time data processing system designed to monitor weather conditions in major metros in India using the OpenWeatherMap API. It retrieves weather data such as temperature, feels-like temperature, and main weather conditions at configurable intervals.

## Key Features:

**Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Continuously fetch weather data for metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad.
**Daily Weather Summaries:** Calculate daily aggregates including average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and dominant weather conditions.
**Alert System:** Configure thresholds for weather conditions (e.g., temperature exceeding 35Â°C) and trigger alerts if conditions are met.
**Temperature Conversion:** Supports converting temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit based on user preference.
**Visualizations:** Display daily summaries, historical weather trends, and triggered alerts.
**Additional Features:**

Extend support for extra weather parameters like humidity and wind speed.
Explore weather forecasts and predicted condition summaries.
